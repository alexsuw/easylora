# Governance

## Overview

easylora uses a lightweight BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) governance model
appropriate for its current stage.

## Maintainer

The project is maintained by [@alexsuw](https://github.com/alexsuw), who has
final decision-making authority on:

- Roadmap and feature scope
- API design and breaking changes
- Release schedule
- Dependency choices

## Decision Making

- Design proposals and significant changes are discussed in GitHub Issues or
  Discussions before implementation.
- Small bug fixes and documentation improvements can go directly to PR.
- All PRs require at least one maintainer review.

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
process. Consistent, high-quality contributors may be invited as maintainers.

## Evolution

As the project grows, governance may evolve to include a core team with shared
maintainer responsibilities. Changes to governance will be proposed via PR
to this file.
